# Maya Brainwave Creator (maya-brain-wave-maker)

## Creates a 3D object in Autodesk Maya from a CSV file

This script was initially created to take data from an Emotiv Insight EEG headset and transform it into a 3D model in Maya. 
However, past its intended use, it can be used to create a 3D object respresenting any CSV File in both an all channel polygon model on individual CV curve representation.
The curve functionality is still being tested, improved, and ironed out, so at the moment the only fully functioning representations are all channel polygon and single channel curve
